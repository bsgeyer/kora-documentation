Admin Access to functionality in the admin section varies by user role, but can include: users, jobs, and settings. Modules This section opens with basic information on managing the modules which extend the functionality of your Omeka S installation and sites. It then offers specific documentaiton for Omeka S modules created by RRCHNM, listed in alphabetial order.

Administrative interface Basic search There is a search field near the top of the left-hand menu, just underneath the user information. This search field works as a keyword search across all the properties for a resource. By default, this search operates on items in your installation. However, you can use the ellipses (three dots) to open a menu and change the resource type being searched, selecting from Items, Item Sets, or Media. Item advanced search Advanced search for items only is available on the Items page, from the Advanced Search link above the table of items. The advanced search loads on a new page, and has the following options: Search full-text: runs a full-text search on all of the text for every item in the installation. Search by value: search for a term or phrase which you enter The first selector allows you to specify a property to search. The second selector allows you to set the relationship the property has with the value. The options are: is exactly, is not exactly, contains, does not contain, is resource with ID, is not resource with ID, has any value (there is something in the property), and has no values. Finally, there is a text field for you to enter the value you want the property to have. To find a resource ID, go to the resource and look at the url in your browser's address bar. The numbers at the end of the url are the resource ID. Search by class: select a class by which to search from the dropdown menu Search by template: select a resource template from the dropdown. Templates are arranged by owner, then alphabetically. Search by item set: select from a dropdown of item sets. In site pool: select from a dropdown menu of all the sites on the Omeka S installation, sorted by user-owner. Searches by value, class, template, and item set allow you to search by more than one input - use the add new buttons to search with more than one value or item set. These search terms build - searching for two item sets will return all items in either item set, rather than only those items which are in both. You can remove value and item set searches using the red trash can icon to the right of those search options. You can reset your search terms at any time by using the \"Reset\" button on the upper right next to the \"Search\" button. Media advanced search Advanced search for media is accessed from the Media browse page, from the Advanced Search link above the table of item sets.

The second selector allows you to set the relationship the property has with the value. The options are: is exactly, is not exactly, contains, does not contain, is resource with ID, is not resource with ID, has any value (there is something in the property), and has no values. Finally, there is a text field for you to enter the value you want the property to have. To find a resource ID, go to the resource and look at the url in your browser's address bar. The numbers at the end of the url are the resource ID. You can remove value searches using the red trash can icon to the right of the value settings. Search by Class: select a class by which to search from the dropdown menu Search by template: select a resource template from the dropdown. Templates are arranged by owner, then alphabetically. Searches by value, class, and template allow you to search by more than one input - use the add new buttons to search with more than one value or item set.

You can remove value and item set searches using the red trash can icon to the right of those search options.

Public views The exact appearance of the search interface will vary based on the theme selected. However, the way search works should be consistent regardless of theme. All of the screenshots in this section are from a site using the the Default theme. Basic search There is a search bar near the menu for each site. In the default theme, it is located just beneath the main menu, as shown in the image below. This search bar works as a full-text search for the whole site. It will search all of the items, item sets, and media as well as the content of every page published on the site. Results are sorted by type, grouping together page results and item or item set results. From the initial results page, you can view all the results for that type (page, item) using the \"view all results\" link. Advanced item search Site visitors can access an advanced item search from the Browse Items page, if you have that page accessible. There is a link for Advanced search between the pagination and the sort options at the top of the item browse table.
